## Heading 
### Heading 2 
    < code goes here> 

It's very easy to make some words **bold** and other words *italic* with Markdown. You can even [link to Google!](http://google.com)

# This is an h1 <h1> tag
## This is an h2 <h2> tag
###### This is an h6 <h6> tag

*This text will be italic*
_This will also be italic_

**This text will be bold**
__This will also be bold__

_You **can** combine them_

## Unordered
* Item 1
* Item 2
  * Item 2a
  * Item 2b

## Ordered
1. Item 1
1. Item 2
1. Item 3
   1. Item 3a
   1. Item 3b

## Blockquotes
As Kanye West said:

> We're living the future so
> the present is our past.

## Inline Code

I think you should use an
`<addr>` element here instead.

```javascript
function fancyAlert(arg) {
  if(arg) {
    $.facebox({div:'#foo'})
  }
}
```
    function fancyAlert(arg) {
      if(arg) {
        $.facebox({div:'#foo'})
      }
    }

def foo():
    if not bar:
        return True

## Task Lists (only on github)

- [x] @mentions, #refs, [links](), **formatting**, and <del>tags</del> supported
- [x] list syntax required (any unordered or ordered list supported)
- [x] this is a complete item
- [ ] this is an incomplete item

## Tables
You can create tables by assembling a list of words and dividing them with hyphens - (for the first row), and then separating each column with a pipe |:

First Header | Second Header
------------ | -------------
Content from cell 1 | Content from cell 2
Content in the first column | Content in the second column

Automatic linking for URLs
Any URL (like dkcenterofarts.netlify.com) will be automatically converted into a clickable link.

Strikethrough
Any word wrapped with two tildes (like ~~this~~) will appear crossed out.

If you want to embed images, this is how you do it:

# Structured documents

Sometimes it's useful to have different levels of headings to structure your documents. Start lines with a `#` to create headings. Multiple `##` in a row denote smaller heading sizes.

### This is a third-tier heading

You can use one `#` all the way up to `######` six for different heading sizes.

If you'd like to quote someone, use the > character before the line:

> Coffee. The finest organic suspension ever devised... I beat the Borg with it.
> - Captain Janeway


# Header 1 #
## Header 2 ##
### Header 3 ###             (Hashes on right are optional)
#### Header 4 ####
##### Header 5 #####

## Markdown plus h2 with a custom ID ##         {#id-goes-here}
[Link back to H2](#id-goes-here)

This is a paragraph, which is text surrounded by whitespace. Paragraphs can be on one 
line (or many), and can drone on for hours.  

Here is a Markdown link to [Warped](https://warpedvisions.org), and a literal <http://link.com/>. 
Now some SimpleLinks, like one to [google] (automagically links to are-you-
feeling-lucky), a [wiki: test] link to a Wikipedia page, and a link to 
[foldoc: CPU]s at foldoc.  

Now some inline markup like _italics_,  **bold**, and `code()`. Note that underscores in 
words are ignored in Markdown Extra.

![picture alt](/images/photo.jpeg "Title is optional")     

> Blockquotes are like quoted text in email replies
>> And, they can be nested

* Bullet lists are easy too
- Another one
+ Another one

1. A numbered list
2. Which is numbered
3. With periods and a space

And now some code:

    // Code is just text indented a bit
    which(is_easy) to_remember();

~~~

// Markdown extra adds un-indented code blocks too

if (this_is_more_code == true && !indented) {
    // tild wrapped code blocks, also not indented
}

~~~

Text with  
two trailing spaces  
(on the right)  
can be used  
for things like poems  

### Horizontal rules

* * * *
****
--------------------------

<div class="custom-class" markdown="1">
This is a div wrapping some Markdown plus.  Without the DIV attribute, it ignores the 
block. 
</div>

## Markdown plus tables ##

| Header | Header | Right  |
| ------ | ------ | -----: |
|  Cell  |  Cell  |   $10  |
|  Cell  |  Cell  |   $20  |

* Outer pipes on tables are optional
* Colon used for alignment (right versus left)

## Markdown plus definition lists ##

Bottled water
: $ 1.25
: $ 1.55 (Large)

Milk
Pop
: $ 1.75

* Multiple definitions and terms are possible
* Definitions can include multiple paragraphs too

Markdown provides backslash escapes for the following characters:

\   backslash
`   backtick
*   asterisk
_   underscore
{}  curly braces
[]  square brackets
()  parentheses
#   hash mark
+   plus sign
-   minus sign (hyphen)
